                    metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

                    You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs, hyperparameter tuning
                    jobs, batch transform jobs, models, labeling jobs, work teams, endpoint configurations,
                    and endpoints. For more information on adding tags to SageMaker resources,
                    see AddTags (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AddTags.html).
